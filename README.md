This repository contains a set of notes I have used to teach an introductory course in synthetic biology at the University of Washington. It is incomplete and out of date, but I offer it here as a starting point for those teaching similar courses. I would be more than happy to have collaborators update the text, add new chapters, and so on. Please contact my if you are interested.
