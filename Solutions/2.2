2.2) There are four letters: A, T, C and G. Codons are three letters long, so that's 64 possible codons. We need codons for the 20 common amino acids and a stop codon, requiring 21 distinct codons. The remaining 64-21=43 codons can be redundant and therefore distributed among the 21 options. The number of ways to choose the 21 codons is 64 \times 63 \times ... \times 44 = 64!/43!. That leaves 43 unassigned codons. Since there are 21 choices for where to put each unassigned codon, we get 2143 possibilities. The final answer is, thus, 21^{43}64!/43! \approx 1.5 \times 10^{93}. Given all of the possibilities for genetic codes, life has chosen a particular one. Small changes to the code are likely detrimental to the performance of the individual because, for example, they assign similar codons to amino acids that are poor substitutes for each other. In fact, this lack of robustness has been argued in the literature. Furthermore, random genetic codes tend to be less robust for a variety of reasons. It therefore seems likely that the current genetic code is a locally the most robust (small changes decrease robustness) so that in order for evolution to find a better one, many simultaneous changes would have to be made in very few generations -- which is unlikely.
