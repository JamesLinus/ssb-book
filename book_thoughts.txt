What are the pros and cons of devoting my sabbatical year to
writing/finishing a text on "synthetic biology"?

Pros
  - Useful for my group and my students
  - Might learn something

Cons
  - Likely to be many such books coming out soon. 
  - A thorough book needs to have tons of literature review -- which I hate
 
How can I focus the book on the set of topics of interest to me -- or
that I have some expertise on? To some extent I don't know enough to
write this book. There is so much out there already that I can't
imagine spending all my time cataloging it all. I'd rather focus on
one thing. 

Maybe I want to write just the stochastics book? For this there are
way fewer papers and competing groups to worry about.

What would go into the book?
  - Biology
    + dogma
    + useful mechanisms
  - Models of biochemical reactions
  - Models computation
  - Models of control systems
  - Examples

What are the goals of the course?
  - Students should be able to 
      + design and analyze new systems
      + understand what is practical
